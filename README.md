## Information

<details><summary><h3>How to use</h3></summary>

There are 3 good methods to using these scripts:
1. Importing one of the Bookmarklets.html files using [these instructions](https://github.com/Minesraft2/Blooket-Cheats/blob/main/tutorial/readme.md)
2. Going to the [GitHub pages site](https://minesraft2.github.io/Blooket-Cheats), choosing a gamemode, then dragging a cheat to your bookmarks bar or clicking one to copy the script
3. Copying a script and running it in the inspect element console

<details><summary><h3>What can I do if JavaScript is blocked?</h3></summary>

We don't actually know what to do about this or how to fix it, sorry.
</details>

<details><summary><h3>(script) is not working?</h3></summary>

Make sure you're running it properly (see [How to use](https://github.com/Minesraft2/Blooket-Cheats#how-to-use)), if it still doesn't work and other cheats do, then [make an issue](https://github.com/Minesraft2/Blooket-Cheats/issues)

<details><summary><h3>What is the difference between obfuscated and unobfuscated?</h3></summary>

Obfuscated are scripts that are changed to be unreadable, unobfuscated are the original scripts (both with an added update checker).
Unobfuscated scripts will not work if you try copying it and pasting it into a bookmarklet. This is because of the lack of semicolons in certain places. Please either use the obfuscated scripts or use one of the methods mentions in the first FAQ

<details><summary><h3>Can you give me infinite tokens / bypass daily limit / permanently give me blooks / change pack luck?</h3></summary>

No, these are things we would've already done if they were possible, they're managed on the backend of Blooket so we can't modify them
</details>

<details><summary><h3>Can you make hacks for (game)</h3></summary>

I'll start making scripts for other games when the Blooket scripts stop needing so much maintenance
</details>

<details><summary><h3>Can you make more Battle Royale cheats</h3></summary>

Battle Royale is a gamemode that works almost entirely on the host's end. The only thing we have control over is answering questions.
</details>

<details><summary><h3>Are you the same person as gliz?</h3></summary>

No, I am not gliz. I'm a close friend who worked on the original Blooket cheats with him and took over after he got a cease and desist.
</details>

<details><summary><h3>How do I do this on mobile?</h3></summary>

These scripts aren't made for mobile, so we don't really know how to get them to work on it.
</details>

<details><summary><h3>What's the Mobile GUI?</h3></summary>

The mobile GUI is the original GUI I made long ago. Some people said it worked on mobile and it's a lot neater for mobile use apparently so we just called it that.
