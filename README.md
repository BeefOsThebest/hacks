## Information

<details><summary><h3>How to use</h3></summary>

There are 3 good methods to using these scripts:
1. Importing one of the Bookmarklets.html files using [these instructions](https://github.com/Minesraft2/Blooket-Cheats/blob/main/tutorial/readme.md)
2. Going to the [GitHub pages site](https://minesraft2.github.io/Blooket-Cheats), choosing a gamemode, then dragging a cheat to your bookmarks bar or clicking one to copy the script
3. Copying a script and running it in the inspect element console

<details><summary><h3>Can you give me infinite tokens / bypass daily limit / permanently give me blooks / change pack luck?</h3></summary>

No, these are things we would've already done if they were possible, they're managed on the backend of Blooket so we can't modify them
</details>

<details><summary><h3>Can you make hacks for (game)</h3></summary>

I'll start making scripts for other games when the Blooket scripts stop needing so much maintenance
</details>

<details><summary><h3>Can you make more Battle Royale cheats</h3></summary>

Battle Royale is a gamemode that works almost entirely on the host's end. The only thing we have control over is answering questions.
</details>

<details><summary><h3>How do I do this on mobile?</h3></summary>

These scripts aren't made for mobile, so we don't really know how to get them to work on it.
